## What is a Data Management Plan?
A data management plan (DMP) is a formal document that describes the data produced in the course of a research project. 

It outlines the data management strategies that will be implemented both during the active phase of the research project and after the project ends.

Making plans for how you will collect, document, organize, and preserve your data are all part of the data management strategy.

## Why write a DMP?
Well-managed data allows for: 

* verification or refinement of published research results

* reduces the potential for scientific fraud 

* promotes new research through the use of existing data

* provides resources for training new researchers

* discourages unintentional redundancy in research

### Why do funding agencies want DMPs?

* **For transparency and openness**: publicly funded research data must be discoverable, accessible, and reusable to the public

* **Return on investment**: well planned data maximizes the research potential of the data and provides greater returns on public investments and research

## When write a DMP?
A DMP is a **living document**, the initial version is written the same time as a new project idea is emerging, and then successively updated as the project continues and new decisions are made:

**Project planning:** The DMP should outline the strategies for data management in sufficient detail to be able to estimate the resources needed to implement the DMP, so that this can be included in the proposal for funding (e.g. data production, data analysis, storage during and after project, costs related to publishing of data).

**Project start:** The DMP is completed with more details e.g. about documentation, data quality measures, file and folder strategies, etc.

**Project end:** The DMP is updated a final time with e.g. links to published data and details about archiving (what data and where), so that this document enables future re-use of the project (by yourself or others).

## How write a DMP?
Standard DMP templates can typically be found at funder agencies, e.g. [Vetenskapsr√•det](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/requirements-terms-and-conditions/producing-a-data-management-plan.html) and [Science Europe](https://www.scienceeurope.org/media/jezkhnoo/se_rdm_practical_guide_final.pdf), and it is of course possible to write in your favorite text editor.

However, the questions in these templates are quite high-level, with little or no guidance on how to answer them.

Luckily, there are tools to assist you: 

* [DMPOnline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) - This is the tool most universities have chosen to offer, good guidance but typically not Life Science specific

* [Data Stewardship wizard](http://dsw.scilifelab.se/) - SciLifeLab, Life Science specific guidance
